# Intro to XR

- People have always sort to create and share fantasy environments, characters and objcets that are not present in our current existence. The aspiration to create and augment realities

- arguable first sorts of immersive experiences ancestors had were playing as children
- Many forms of play involve pretending, simulating a scenario rather than representing it with symbols or words

- Archeologists believe that sandstone lamps and fireplaces ewere used not only to light the Greaet Hall of the Bulls in southern France, the 17,000 year ago cave containg neolithic paintings, but also to create flickering, moving effect; essentially animating these majestic creatures

- full rooom sized murals known as frescos were also used in the medieval period to simulate a feeling of a spiritual realm

Why hasn't extended reality grown into a more prominent art form, alongside the likes of literature, film, music, etc.? 
- While experiences can submerge a viewer, it's hard to scale these eexperiences, it's hard to distribute them

When did VR and AR devices arguably start?
- In around 1830, during the early days of photography, the stereoscope was invented which showed two slightly different images to each eye to create a 3D effect. It was incredibly popular until the 1860s when it was replaced by what were essentially small photos

What was the Sword of Damocles?
- a head-mounted AR machine produced by Ivan Sutherland, the father of Computer Graphics, that allowed users to "step into data", what is now called spatial computing

Why was VPL Research in the 1980s important?
- Jaron Lanier's company, creaetede a whole VR system with bodysuit, headset and gloves
  
What problems hindered VR devices in the 1980s and 90s?
- Many headsets made users feeel sick and users couldn't use them for that long. This was due to latency, the graphics lagged ever so slightly behind users head movements

Catherine Allen on XR
- about putting an individual or group's imagination, bottling it and putting it somewhere else

Who first refined the concept of the reality-virtuality continuum?
- Paul Milgram, an engineering professor at the University of Toronto in his seminal paper, A Taxonomy of Mixed Reality Visual Displays

CEO of The Void
- Reality is way more than just what you see, so you need to represent all these different things

What is Spatial Computing?
- the practice of using physical actions as inputs to receive outputs in a perceived 3D space

What are thee two main categories of spatial computing?
- 3 degrees of freedom (3DoF) and 6 degrees of freedom (6DoF)

What is 3DoF spatial computing?
- 3DoF sees the user experience a flat 'sphere' of media around them (e.g. a 360 video)

What is 6DoF spatial computing?
- 6DoF actually maps experience into the physical space that thee user inhabits, allowing them to move back and forth and up and down freely in the digital space

Why is simulation a key feature of what extended reality can do?
- Rather than using symbols to represent something, extended reality gives the illusion that it is actually happening.  This means that immersive technology can lend itself to real-life applications that require a suspension of disbelief from users; to interact with something as if it were real
- e.g. soldiers training to drive a tank, dentists practicing different procedures

Why are physiological responses a key feature of what extended reality can do?
- Experiencing a simulatioon can lead to a powerful response. From sweating to increase in heart rate to a sense of calm, immersive experiences can have genuine physiological effects on users. Userful for applications like therapy, where VR experiences can be used as a form of exposure therapy to treat phobias and PTSD

Why is relationship building a key feature of what extended reality can do?
- AR and VR allow people to feel like they are building bonds with others. Virtual characters may or may not be real, but in some ways, it doesn't really matter. If a character looks you in the eye in a 360 video, for instance, and smiles, it is likely you will smile back

Why is embodiment a key feature of what extended reality can do?
- VR can put you in the shoes of another. We call this 'embodiment'. Like acting, playing a role can help users understand others' perspectives. The effect of this in VR could lead to feelings of empathy or even a shift in world view. There have been several studies showing this

What are some risks with VR/AR?
- headset hygiene
- safety buddies
- avoiding nausea
- avoiding repetitive strain injuries
- post-VR decompression
- clear guidance on the user setup for surroundings

XR Ethical Questions
- Would you consider certain content/subject matter to be inappropriate for VR worlds?
- What should be the follow up if someone experiences violence, harassment or bullying within XR?
- Do you have thoughts about how XR should be regulated in this context?

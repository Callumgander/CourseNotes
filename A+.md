### Laptop Hardware

#### Hard drive 
- Most laptops use smaller 2.5 inche SSD drives
- What is a SSD (s olid-state drive)?
  - All memory, no moving parts
  - Silent, fast access time, less latency
  - 2.5 inch and 1.8 inch form factors
- What is a Hybrid Drive?
  - SSHD
  - soldi-state hybrid drive
  - flash memory and hard drive storage 
  - SSD caches the hard drive data
- Magnetic Disk
  - Traditional spinning drive platters
- Replacing laptop storage
- all internal
  - open a cover on the back
  - open the entire laptop
- can be very modular
  - two screws and the drive slides out
- Latop

#### RAM
- Types of memory used laptops and mobile devices)
- small outline dual in-line memory module (So-DIMM)
- micro-dual in-line memory module (Micro-DIMM) 
- remove by holding the edges

#### Smart Card Reader
- Integrated card reader built into the laptop
- external reader connected by a USB

#### Wireless card
- May be a number of different wireless cards
- WLAN - internet
- WWAN - cellular based
- WPAN - bluetooth 
- Different form factors too
  - mini PCI
  - mini PCI express (smaller than mini PCI)

#### Video card
- often built into the processor and hence not upgradeable
- sometimes part of the system board, so again, not upgradeable
- Some laptops have upgradeable video cards and usually not slimline systems
  
#### Screen
- LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)
  - light and high-resolution
- very, very fragile so get a good case
- resolutions are fixed
  - changes to native resolution may look blurry or not as crisp

#### Laptop Power
- our computers need DC to operate, most desktops have a power supply built into the case
- on laptops, without that amount of room, the power conversion is done on an external device that provides DC power directly into the laptop
- two types of AC adapters: auto-switching or fixed input 
  - converts AC to DC
  - input voltage is 110-220 volts
- DC jack on the laptop is specific to the power supply type
- most common types of batteries are lithium ion (Li-ion)
  - common in consumer electronics
  - no "memory effect"
  - charging the battery diminishes capacity
  - different form factor for each laptop

#### Laptop frame
- plastic
  - lightweight, mobile
  - durable, difficult to break
  - inexpensive, cost-effective
- metal
  - more durable than plastic
  - can be more difficult to repair

#### Speaker
- self-contained
  - portable audio
- not the highest quality
  - very small
- Often stereo (L/R)
  - may include a subwoofer

#### System board
- proprietary
  - Built to fit
- replacement isn't easy
  - swap the entire board
  - most components are on the system board

#### CPU
- designed for mobility
  - power management
- Integrated features
  - memory controller
  - video controller
- not very upgradable
  - replaceable, but not upgradable
- often slower than desktops
  - size and heat disadvantages

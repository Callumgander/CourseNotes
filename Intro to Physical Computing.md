# Intro to Physical Computing 

What do we call a computer integrated into a real-world environment?
- an embedded system

What is physical computing?
- A combination of hardware, software and materials leading to products and designs that 'interface with the real world'
- Physical computing is concerned with developing hardware devices that can sense and act in the real world

What is an input transducer and what does it do?
- Input transducers are sensors, they are a way of sensing the world through measuring physical energy, activity or expression

What are some examples of sensors?
- button press, light value, proximity, heartrate monitor, temperature, speed 

What are output transducers and what do they do?
- They are actuators. They are methods to change the real world, communicate information or trigger input
- e.g. visual, auditory, robotics, olfactory, haptic...
- Taking digital information and changing it into physical phenomena that manifests in the real world

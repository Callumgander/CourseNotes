# Deep Learning Maths

Just a collection of notes on stats, linear algebra, and calculus. I have gone through bits of this before so some of it is just a refresher whereas other parts are new to me

## Basic Linear Algebra

What is a scalar?
- a single number

What is a vector?
- An ordered array of numbers in either a row or a column. A vector only has a single index, pointing to a specific value within the vector

What is a matrix?
- An ordered 2D array of numbers and it has two indices, the first points to the row and the second to the column

What is m in relation to linear algebra?
- the row

What is n in relation to linear algebra?
- the column

What is a tensor?
- a multidimensional array. It has three indices, the first is for the row, the second is for the column and the third is for the axis. For example, T232 points to the second row, the third column, and the second axis

How do you do matrix-scalar operations? 
- Just multiple each of the elements in the matrix by the scalar

How do you do matrix-scalar multiplication?
- multiply each row of the matrix by the column of the vector, so the first number by x and the second number in the row by y of the column. The sum the results of the rows to get the output which is a vector

# CourseNotes
 A collection of my notes from various courses

Some of these are MOOCs, some tutorials, some are just portable wikis of problems and solutions for specific languages, e.g. bash

It's also worth noting that this is far from complete, I wrote my notes for courses prior to 2019 by hand and am slowly transcribing them into markdown

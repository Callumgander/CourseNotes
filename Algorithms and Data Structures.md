# Algorithms and Data Structures

Just a general collection of notes taken on an array of lectures related to algorithms and data structures

## Depth First and Breadth First Graph Search

Depth First Search
- Implemented with a stack, either of our own or the call stack via recursion (LIFO)
- It goes deep, follows a path to it's end

When do you use Depth First Search?
- Backtracking, complete search, exhausting possible paths

Breadth First Search
- Implemented Iteratively with a queue (FIFO)
- It goes wide, keeps expanding until all paths are found

What are Breadth First Search?
- Check if a path exists between nodes, finding "hops" or distance out or "levels" outs

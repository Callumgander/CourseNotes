# Building Your Own Programming Language

What are some practical use cases for making your own language without trying to build something like python?
- Domain-specific languages: Terraform, Gemfiles
- Templating languages: Handlebars, Jade

What are the stages of a compiler?
- Parsing: take the source code and turn it into a representation of that code 
- Transformation: take that source code and transforms it to do whatever the compiler wants it to do
- Generation: take the transformed representation and turns it into a new string of code

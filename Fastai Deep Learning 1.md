# Fast.ai Deep Learning Part 1

What is an ImageDataBunch?
- Represents all of the data you need to build a model

What is overfitting?
- where you don't learn to see the general thing you're trying to look for but you learn how to see the specific data you trained your model on
- for example, instead of learning how to see cricket players generally, you learn how to identify a specific player because the dataset was disproportionately photos of him 

What do we use to try and prevent overfitting?
- a validation set

What is a validation set?
- a portion of your dataset that the model does not train on but which is used to validate that those it was tested on didn't cause the model to overfit to that specific dataset

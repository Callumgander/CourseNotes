What was perlin noise developed for?
- procedural textures for three-dimensional objects in computer graphics

What type of random number does perlin noise give you?
- smooth random numbers, so the number before or after is closely related

What is an interpolation function?
- basically how the line between data points are drawn, a linear interpolation is just a straight line between each

What is an interpolation function that draws curved lines called?
- a cosine interpolation

## Chapter 1: Vectors

What is a scalar? 
- something with magnitude

What is a vector?
- something with magnitude and direction
- Basically an arrow

Where is the origin on a p5 canvas?
- the top left

What are the components of a vector?
- the x and y coordinate

What is a static function?
- One that isn't called on an individual object but on the class as a whole
- e.g. p5.Vector.random2D()  calls random2D on the p5.Vector class

# Webpack Fundamentals

What are the two ways to use Javascript in web development?
- using scripts, i.e. <script src="index.js">
- writing inside the script tag itself
- problems include: too many scripts, unmaintainable scripts

What is an iife and why are they relevant?
- immediately invoked function expression
- Allows you to have multiple variables with the same names that don't affect each other because they are lexically scoped, and so scope collision won't occur

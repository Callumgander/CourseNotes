#Nand2Tetris

##Intro

- All of these notes are from the nand2tetris course on coursera
- You don't have to worry about the "how" only about the "what", higher level programming languages, like python or javascript, abstract you away from the lower level components and their related abstractions, like bytes and machine code
- You only have to worry about the current layer of abstraction until something goes wrong then you might have to worry about lower levels 
- You should at least be aware of the multiple layers of abstraction: elementary logic gates -> CPU, RAM, chipset -> computer architecture -> low level code -> VM code -> high level language
- Nand2Tetris part 1: combinatorial logic -> comb. and seq. logic -> digital design 
- building a chip: design. Take a chip abstraction, specifically Xor, and make a chip diagram with it using the software provided. Then use the diagram to specify it using HDL to make a HDL program. Test it with scripts provided and simulate with the hardware simulator provided 

##Six different projects
- Week 1: Elementary logic gates
- Week 2: Arithmetic-Logic Unit
- Week 3: Registers and memory
- Week 4: Writing low-level programs
- Week 5: Computer architecture
- Week 6: Developing an assembler
